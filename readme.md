# BS-MS Project Thesis
# Introduction to Complex Dynamics and the Mandelbrot Set

In this project, I studied the dynamics of rational maps on the complex sphere, mainly from
the book "Iterations of Rational functions" by Alan F. Beardon.  
I also referred to "Dynamics of One Complex variable" by John Milnor.

I also studied from other sources, but have not referred from them in this project report:
1. "Orsay Notes" by A. Douady.
2. "Periodic Orbits, External rays and the Mandelbrot set" by John Milnor.
