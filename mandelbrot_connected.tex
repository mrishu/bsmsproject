\chapter{Connectedness of the Mandelbrot Set}
In the previous chapter, we proved that the Mandelbrot set is compact and \( \mathbb{C}\bs M \)
is open and connected. In this chapter, we will prove that \( \Cinf\bs M \) is biholomorphic
to the open unit disc, proving that it is simply connected. This will imply that \( M \) is connected by \Cref{thm1.1}.
